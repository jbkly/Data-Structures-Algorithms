# Data Structures & Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.

`yarn test` or `npm t` to run Jest tests.

## Contents

### Data Structures

#### Graphs

- [Disjoint-set/Union-find](graphs/disjoint-set.js)

#### Trees

- [Binary search tree](trees/binarySearchTree)
- [Binary heap (min-heap)](trees/minHeap)

### Algorithms

- [Fibonacci sequence](fibonacci)

## Roadmap

- sorting algorithms
- implement common data structures (hashmap, self-balancing binary trees)
- use TypeScript
